#variables are created when a value is assigned to them
x = 3
y = 5

#it will simply print the value of z
z = x*y
print(z) #z will be 15

#declaration of strings
x = "john"
y = 'john' #both are same

print(type(x)) #it will print the type of x which is str

#different data types
x = str(5)   #value will be '5'
y = float(5) #value will be 5.0
z = int(5)   #value will be 5

print(x,y,z) #it will print all three values
